    <p><strong>In June 2017</strong>, I moved to <strong>Medellin, Colombia</strong>. I was immediately struck by the football obsession- it is played everywhere, on the street, anywhere that can it can be, discussed and watched constantly. I decided to return to a sport I had played all my childhood, and was lucky enough to find a women’s team quite quickly. Speaking little spanish, I was welcomed into Las Guerreras futbol club - given the nickname <em>"Betty"</em> - and discovered an exceptional and inspiring subculture of the Colombian football world.</p>
    <p>My teammates come from across the city, and many come from <strong>economically depressed backgrounds</strong> or difficult barrios. With trainings four days a week and at least one game on the weekend, the commitment to Las Guerreras proved to be quite an economic burden to some of the girls, especially when adding the price of paying referees, our trainer, and new kits. The coach and team worked together to try to help those who couldn’t pay.</p>

    <p>As you can read in my teammate’s interviews on the following page, <strong>women’s football</strong> in Colombia remains marginal. Our forward Dani Ocampo describes how, as a child, she was criticized for playing, told it was a men’s sport, mocked and called a “little man”. Many of the women spoke of women’s football being ill received by their families or wider community, of the teasing, stereotypes and lack of support they experienced, however talented they might be.</p>
    <p>Last year, however, marked a positive step in Colombia recognising their female talent. In February 2017, the first ever professional women's league, the <strong>Liga Antioquena feminina</strong>, was formed. Finally, women are permitted to play seriously, provided a hope that football is not a dead-end pursuit, but something that they, too, can take seriously.</p>
    <p><strong>Las Guerreras</strong> has the level to join the <em>professional women’ league</em>. The aim of this request for donations is to pay the club’s <strong>inscription</strong> to the league, as well as to help provide <strong>“scholarships”</strong> to some girls who absolutely cannot afford to pay for the costs of playing. I strongly believe that supporting women’s football in Colombia is an effective way of supporting the empowerment of a group of women who still face much <strong>discrimination</strong> for their class and gender. My teammate Monica Zapata expresses it better than I can: </p>

    <p><em>“I think women's football could help women emancipate themselves in a country where there is so much machismo. Women's football could help women grow economically and also psychologically... to all the young girls who want to play: don't demotivate yourself, things will change in the future, with much sacrifice.<br>Insist, persist and never desist.”</em></p>
